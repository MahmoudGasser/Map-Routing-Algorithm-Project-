# Map-Routing-Algorithm-Project-
This project implements a map routing system that finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph using Dijkstra’s algorithm. It is designed to load map data from files and allow users to query routes efficiently.

Features

Graph Loading from Files: Load nodes and edges from text files representing the map.

Shortest Path Calculation: Use Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the optimal path between any two nodes.

Interactive Queries: Select start and end points to compute and visualize the shortest path.

Visualization: Optionally display the graph and highlight the computed shortest path.

How It Works

Load a map file containing nodes and edges with weights.

Build a graph representation in memory.

Select two nodes (start and end).

Apply Dijkstra’s algorithm to calculate the shortest path.

Output the path and total distance.

Technologies

Language: C# 

GUI: Windows Forms 

Algorithms: Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm

This repository is ideal for learning about graph algorithms, file handling, and routing systems.
